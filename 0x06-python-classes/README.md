Python Classes and Objects Readme
This readme provides a brief overview of Python classes and objects, fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allow you to create structured and reusable code.

Introduction to Classes and Objects
Classes are blueprint templates for creating objects, which are instances of those classes. Objects can contain both data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data. Python's OOP paradigm helps organize code and promotes reusability.

Creating Classes
To create a class, use the class keyword followed by the class name and a colon. Class names typically follow the CamelCase naming convention.
